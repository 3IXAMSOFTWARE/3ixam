3IXAM Dev Tools
#################

This repository is intended for miscellaneous tools, utilities, configurations and
anything that helps with 3IXAM development, but aren't directly related to building 3IXAM.

Some of the tools included may be used stand-alone, others expect 3IXAMs source code to be available.


Usage
=====

While this is a stand-alone repository,
some of the scripts which access 3IXAMs source code assume this repository will be located at
``source/tools`` within 3IXAMs source code repository. At some point this may be included as a submodule.

Some tools also rely on the ``3ixam`` binary, this is assumed to be located at: ``../../3ixam.bin``.
*The root directory of 3IXAM's git repository*
